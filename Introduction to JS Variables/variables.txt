Variables::->
 A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

Why the let was created ?
 i)Hoisting no longer works with let.
 ii)when you use var, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with let you can't.

 Types of Variables::->
  1)Numbers:
    You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). e.g., let myage = 37;

  2)Strings:
    Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks.
    e.g.,let dolphinGoodbye = "So long and thanks for all the fish";
  
  3)Booleans
    Booleans are true/false values â€” they can have two values, true or false.
    e.g., let 6<3;

  4)Arrays
    An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.
    e.g.,let myNameArray = ["Chris", "Bob", "Jim"];
  
  5)Objects
   In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object.
   e.g.,let dog = { name: "Spot", breed: "Dalmatian" };

Dynamic typing::->
  JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc.).

Constants in JavaScript::->
  i)you must initialize them when you declare them
  ii)you can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.

When to use const and when to use let?::->
 Use const when you can, and use let when you have to.
