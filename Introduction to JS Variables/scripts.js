//Variables = A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.
/*One special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything â€” not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.*/
var a  =  5;
alert(a) ; //before ES6 var was used for declaring variables now this is of no more any use
//let and const are now used for declaring variables
let x = "Nitesh",y = 5;
const t = 5;
//if variable is not intialized it contains the value undefined
//t = 2;//TypeError const variables can't be reassigned
//There is concept of hoisting as well we will see in future modules;
//JS Statements : A instruction in program is known as statement.
