<h3>Functions</h3>
<p>functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command â€” rather than having to type out the same code multiple times</p>
<hr>
<h3>Types of Functions<h3>
<ul>
<li>Built-in browser functions </li>
<li>User Defined Functions( custom functions )</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Function V/S Methods</h3>
<p>Functions that are part of objects are called methods</p>

<h3>Function scope and conflicts</h3>
<p>When you create a function, the variables and other things defined inside the function are inside their own separate scope, meaning that they are locked away in their own separate compartments, unreachable from code outside the functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Scope</strong>::The top level outside all your functions is called the global scope.</li>
